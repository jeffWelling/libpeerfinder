<h1>Design</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Theres a few things we want to keep in mind when we are
designing this. &nbsp;We want to make extensive use of plugins
where
ever possible. &nbsp;It will be designed so that the swarms that it
looks for are defined by plugins from the beginning, so all you have to
do to be able to connect to a new swarm is add/write a plugin for it.
&nbsp;It comes with some desireable defaults, such as one to help
with&nbsp;DHTs for torrents. &nbsp;<br>
Its important to remember thought that it would work for DHTs but not
for trackers because trackers don't track each other they only track
peers; DHTs track each other so you can query one DHT to get
information about it's neighbors to connect to. &nbsp;If you were
to try to use libpeerfinder for say, torrent trackers, you might be
able to get it to return a list of some trackers, but those trackers
might not have the torrents your looking for and if they didn't they
wouldn't be of any help to you because they wouldn't help you locate
additonal trackers.<br>
<br>
Another
area that will be modular like the swarm definitions is the methods
that it uses to find peers. &nbsp;It will of course come with
several
defaults such as broadcasting, specialized network scanning to identify
hosts that you are close to topologically, and IRC, but will also allow
for additional methods of locating peers to be defined by writing a
plugin with a few specific hooks.<br>
<br>
<br>
The idea is, you install the application and by default, is configured
to spawn a daemon if there is not one already spawned, and then to
query that daemon instead of other peers - but it can also be used sans
daemon from the command line. &nbsp;The daemon's job is to help
speed up the response time when a call to libpeerfinder is made by
actively maintaining it's tables/lists of peers. &nbsp;Disabling
the daemon and running from the command line make it look for a list of
known peers from previous searches, and try to query them. &nbsp;If
there is no list of known peers, such as would be the case on a first
run after installation, or if none of the peers in the list are
contactable, it goes to the peerfinding plugins to begin hunting for a
peer.<br>
<br>
To use an analogy, having the daemon running is like having a library
in your own town. &nbsp;You can go to the library and ask the
librarian for everything pertaining to X, and they will give you the
list right then and right there because they've been keeping the
library up to date and stocked with books (lists of peers).
&nbsp;Where as not running the daemon would be like having to send
a letter to the neighboring town's librarian to ask for a list of
everything pertaining to X, and they would send the response back to
you in a letter. &nbsp;<br>
To use the analogy to give an idea of what is meant by 'definable
swarms', you would ask the librarian for a list of peers from the 'dht'
section and you would get a list of peers (selected at random) which
are dhts.<br>
<br>
If you were to implement libpeerfinder with a torrent client it would
probably come together as a plugin for the cilent which would help
locate DHTs, so that if every tracker for a torrent was down you could
still find a peer who was hosting a DHT to connect to. &nbsp;At
which point you would have access to the whole network through the
magic of DHTs.<br>
<br>
<p>Additional design suggestions are welcome.</p>
